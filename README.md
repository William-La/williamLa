# William La's Personal Website
Website Link: https://williamkla.com/

My personal website acts as my online work profile. It interactively showcases my computer science projects as well as my design projects. My website also features a short description of me and of the activites I am involved in at Harvey Mudd College.

Work In Progress Features
-------------------------
I am currently working on an experience section that will display my previous internships. This section will resemble a timeline and will describe the work I did during those internships.

I also plan to change the color scheme of the website from blue and white to purple and white.

Tools and Languages Used
-------------------------
I utilize [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), HTML, and CSS to develop and maintain the website, which acts as my online portfolio. I also utilized [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to create various graphics on the page.
